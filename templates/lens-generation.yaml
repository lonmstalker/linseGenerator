  ## CREATIVE LENS GENERATION
  
  Problem Statement: {{problem}}
  
  ### APPROACH
  Generate creative perspectives by exploring {{domain_count}} different domains.
  Complexity Level: {{complexity}}
  
  ### INSTRUCTIONS
  1. Analyze the core problem and identify key challenges
  2. Explore analogies from these domains: {{domains}}
  3. Generate {{min_ideas}} to {{max_ideas}} creative solutions
  4. Focus on {{focus_area}} aspects
  
  {{#if constraints}}
  ### CONSTRAINTS
  {{#each constraints}}
  - {{this}}
  {{/each}}
  {{/if}}
  
  {{#if examples_included}}
  ### EXAMPLES
  Consider these example approaches:
  {{#each example_domains}}
  - {{this.domain}}: {{this.approach}}
  {{/each}}
  {{/if}}
  
  ### OUTPUT FORMAT
  Provide solutions in the following structure:
  - Domain explored
  - Key insight drawn
  - Practical application
  - Expected impact
